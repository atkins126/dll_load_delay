Source code and demonstration project for the
Delphi Magazine article "DelayLoading of DLLs".

All the source code provided with this article is freeware.

The demo project compiles and runs with Delphi 2, 3 and 4.
For Delphi 2 and 3 you need to compile the DLL (the
Testdll.Dpr) first. For Delphi 4, open the project group
(ImpExpLinking.bpg) and do 'Project|Build all projects'.

I have provided pre-compiled versions of the DLL and EXE
file, but they are compiled in Delphi 4 using packages,
so you will need the VCL40 packages to run it.
